* Camera Calibration
*1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.*

The code for calibrating the camera and undistorting images are shown in =lane_lines.Chessboard= and =lane_lines.Calibration=. An example which runs the code is shown in =test_lane_lines.CalibrationTest.test_calibrate_camera_from_filename()=.

The calibration method works by analysing images of chessboards taken from different angles and distances (these were provided and are in =camera_cal=). The OpenCV function =findChessboardCorners= then detects the edges between the chess board squares. The sets of these detected corners in multiple images are then fed into the OpenCV =calibrateCamera= function which, using the fact that in reality the corners are equally spaced, calculates and returns the calibration and distortion coefficients.
